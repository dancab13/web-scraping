BCS Module 11 Web Scraping Challenge

This repo contains materials for the Module 11 web scraping challenge. Files include this readme, two Jupyter Notebook files, and an output folder with a CSV of the results of the second part of the challenge.

All code is my own. Xpert Learning Assistant helped me clarify some code, like some iterations.
